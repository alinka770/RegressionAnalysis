# RegressionAnalysis
The aim of the work is to acquaint oneself with the fundamentals of regression analysis, the linear regression model, and its recovery procedure. This will enable me to acquire skills in recovering this model using real data.


This project aims to perform regression analysis on a given dataset - Abalone(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone). Among the indicators in the dataset, there is one that needs to be predicted based on the others. This indicator is referred to as the dependent or target variable.
